# LearnReact
I am teaching myself React. This is where my exercise code will go.

I have been programming a long time and realized that my javascript axe is pretty dull. I decided to teach myself React outside of work.

After learning some basics I found the 100 days of React lesson plan by Lenora Porter. While my family life will keep me from coding every day I plan do devote as much time as I can to teaching myself Reaact. I started on 9/3/2019. So far I am really enjoying Typescript, the React framework, and Visual Studio Code.
