# LearnReact

## Description
I am teaching myself React. This is where my exercise code will go.

I have been programming a long time and realized that my javascript axe is pretty dull. I decided to teach myself React outside of work.

After learning some basics I found the 100 days of React lesson plan by Lenora Porter. While my family life will keep me from coding every day I plan do devote as much time as I can to teaching myself Reaact. I started on 9/3/2019. So far I am really enjoying Typescript, the React framework, and Visual Studio Code.

[Here is my learning plan](https://medium.com/@LenoraPorter/learning-react-in-100-days-229c45d906a3 "Learn React in 100 Days by Lenora Porter")

I am having a lot of fun reconnecting with Javascript, creating UI's, and learning how to use Visual Studio Code.


## React code Exercises

* [Week 1](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-netflix-with-react-in-10-minutes?source=post_page--------------------------- "Build a Mini Netflix with React in 10 Minutes")
    * I coded on this but couldn't get it to work. I might come back to this exercise after I get more React experience
    * I coded the tutorial on [ReactJs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) in Visual Studio Code instead
* [Week 2](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-react-to-do-app-with-react-hooks-no-class-components?source=post_page-----229c45d906a3---------------------- "Build a React To-Do App with React Hooks (No Class Components)")
    * I had fun completing this exercise
    * I am all for learning new things like React Hooks but week 2 might be a bit early to introduce this
* [Week 3](https://auth0.com/blog/react-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app/?source=post_page-----229c45d906a3---------------------- "React Tutorial: Building and Securing Your First App")
    * I really enjoyed completing this in VS Code
    * I'm glad the following new topics were included
        * Calling a backend API
        * Securing your application with Autoh0
        * Using the React router
* [Week 4](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-airbnb-clone-with-react-and-elasticsearch?source=post_page-----229c45d906a3---------------------- "Build an Airbnb Clone with React and ElasticSearch")
    * I only read this exercise since I couldn't get the Elasticsearch instance running on appbase.io
    * I may give this exercise another try down the road
* [Week 5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-react-js-chat-app-in-10-minutes-c9233794642b/?source=post_page-----229c45d906a3---------------------- "Learn to build a React chat app in 10 minutes - React JS tutorial")
    * Challenged myself by writing this with create-react-app instead of putting everything in the index.js file
		* Figured out how to add the chatkit SDK with npm using documentation on the Chatkit site
		* Used the Chatkit documentation to figure out how the SDK (message JSON ) has evolved
    * Another fun lesson in calling an api from a component
